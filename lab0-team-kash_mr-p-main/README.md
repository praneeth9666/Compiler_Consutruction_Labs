# Lab 0
A lab on AST manipulation.

This lab is a "partial" lab, and will be graded less rigorously than future labs.  The goal of this lab is to ensure that you start early enough to complete your first full compiler (assigned as Lab 1).  As a partial lab, there is no autograder enabled on this repository, and your Lab 0 submission will be evaluated during your coding interview for Lab 1.

## Lab Requirements

Complete exercises 1.2, 1.3, 1.4, 1.5, and 1.6.  Exercise 1.2 requires you to write several P0 programs - put them in a separate directory.  Exercises 1.3, 1.4, 1.5, and 1.6 should each be implemented as separate executables, and you should test them on the P0 programs you wrote for Exercise 1.2.  Your solutions should be committed and pushed to this repository.

## Submission Instructions

***In general, for a class homework, you will:***

1.  Follow a link to gain access to the assignment.  This will copy the assignment starter code into a new git repo in your github account.  

2.  Use the assignment repo as normal to develop your solution, committing and pushing regularly to it.

3.  When your assignment is complete, make sure to push your final commit.  Once you've pushed, note the url of the commit on github.com's online interface to this repo.  It will be of the form:
```
https://github.com/csci4555-this_semester/lab0-yourusername/commit/a_really_long_number_representing_the_commit
```
4.  Submit this url on canvas as your assignment submission.  All project members should submit a link.
